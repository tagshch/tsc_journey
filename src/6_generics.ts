T allows us to capture the type the user provides (e.g. number), 
so that we can use that information later. 

Here, we use T again as the return type. On inspection, we can now see 
the same type is used for the argument and the return type. 

This allows us to traffic that type information in one side of the function and out the other.

Notice that we didn’t have to explicitly pass the type in the angle brackets (<>); 
the compiler just looked at the value "myString", and set T to its type.

/* --- 
When we do, the compiler will give us an error that we’re using the .length member of arg, 
but nowhere have we said that arg has this member. 

Remember, we said earlier that these type variables stand in for any and all types, 
so someone using this function could have passed in a number instead, 
which does not have a .length member.

Let’s say that we’ve actually intended this function to work on arrays of T 
rather than T directly. Since we’re working with arrays, 
the .length member should be available. We can describe this just 
like we would create arrays of other types:
--- */

function loggingIdentity<T>(arg: T[]): T[]
{
	console.log(arg.length); // Array has a .length, so no more error
	return arg;
}

/* --- 
You can read the type of loggingIdentity as 
“the generic function loggingIdentity takes a type parameter T, 
and an argument arg which is an array of Ts, and returns an array of Ts.” 

If we passed in an array of numbers, we’d get an array of numbers back out, 
as T would bind to number. 

This allows us to use our generic type variable T as part of 
the types we’re working with, rather than the whole type, 
giving us greater flexibility.

	console.log(arg.length); // Array has a .length, so no more error
