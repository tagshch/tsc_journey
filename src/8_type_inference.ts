/* ====== TYPE INFERENCE ====== */

let ti_x = 3;

/*
The type of the x variable is inferred to be number. 
This kind of inference takes place when initializing variables and members, 
setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.
*/

/* ===== BEST COMMON TYPE ===== */

/*
When a type inference is made from several expressions, 
the types of those expressions are used to calculate a “best common type”.
*/

let ti_y = [0, 1, null];
